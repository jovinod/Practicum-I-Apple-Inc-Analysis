# Practicum-I-Apple-Inc-Analysis
Apple Inc. has seen a phenomenal growth in the last decade esp. with the launch of its flagship product called iPhone. While Apple Inc. has been in various businesses, iPhone has been the primary revenue generator for the company. As much that between 2014- 2016, iPhone contributed to approximately 70% of the Apple’s Revenue. In the 4th quarter of 2018 iPhone still has 60% of the share of Apple revenue, thus in a way Apple could be called an iPhone company.
In the last six months Apple has been in news for various reasons, including the change in unit sales reporting, potential 10% tariff that could be imposed by the incumbent government, the US China trade war and above all some skepticism about Apple’s future based on the perceived dearth of innovative products in the last few years.
In our analysis we closely observed iPhone, the flagship product for Apple to build our hypothesis about the consumer and investor sentiment about Apple Inc.
